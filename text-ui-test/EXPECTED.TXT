Hello! I'm Nut.
Here are some quick start commands:
- todo <task>
- deadline <task> /by <dd/MM/yyyy [HHmm]>
- event <task> /from <start> /to <end>
- list
- find <keyword>
- mark <task number>
- unmark <task number>
- delete <task number>
- help
- bye

Cracked it. I've added this task: [T] [ ] borrow book
Now you have 4 tasks in your stash.
    I couldn't crack that deadline format.
    Use:
    deadline <name> /by <dd/MM/yyyy HHmm>
    or
    deadline <name> /by <dd/MM/yyyy>

Cracked it. I've added this task: [E] [ ] project meeting (by: Mon 2pm to: 4pm)
