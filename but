git status
```
If it shows the merge is completed, you’re done. If you were merging `origin/master` into your old branch, then push:
```bash
git push origin HEAD
```
---
Run this to preview what `master` has in that file (without fully resolving yet):
```bash
git show origin/master:src/main/java/nut/Task/TaskList.java | head -n 40
```
Tell me: **did you mean to delete `TaskList.java` on your old branch**, or do you want it back from `master`? I’ll confirm the right resolution path.
